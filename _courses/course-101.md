description: 'The American food system is a product of a complex interaction of three
  systems: the natural ecosystem, the managed agricultural system, and the socio-economic
  system. Farming, food processing, food distribution, and consumption decisions are
  all governed by the interaction of these systems. This course investigates a number
  of overarching scientific and social "hot-button" topics that affect or are affected
  by the food system, such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), organic crops
  and food, agricultural and food policy, environmental implications of agricultural
  production, food safety, diet and health, agricultural trade and international development,
  and domestic food insecurity and food access.'
