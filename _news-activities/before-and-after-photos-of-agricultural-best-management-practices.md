  href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391395582_Before_and_After_Photos_of_Agricultural_Best_Management_Practices">This
  report</a> contains photos of agricultural best management practices (BMPs)
  including before-and-after sets of photos and after-only photos. These
  pictures were collected from various agencies and groups and are meant to be
  used by technical assistance providers, conservation practitioners, and others
  who are helping landowners and farmers decide whether to install BMPs. The
  practices shown are: stream crossings, stream exclusion/fencing, streambank
  stabilization, stream buffers, grassed waterways, heavy use area improvement
  (livestock), manure storage, barnyard stabilization and improvements,
  off-stream watering, and rotational grazing.</p><p></p>
