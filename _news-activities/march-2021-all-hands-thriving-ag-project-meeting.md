description: "<p>A Thriving Ag Project All-Hands meeting took place on March 22, 2021.
  The team finalized five draft scenarios for discussion with the Stakeholder Advisory
  Board (SAB) at this meeting. The five draft scenarios were (1) business as usual,
  (2) payments for performance of ecosystem services and achieving nutrient balance,
  (3) managing urban growth and maintaining existing farmland, (4) increasing farm
  profitability through local food efforts and growing urban-rural relationships,
  and (5) a dietary shift to plant-based proteins and alternative meats. Out of the
  meeting came several suggested refinements to the five scenarios that the Project
  Team will be incorporating into its work.</p><p>The project team will be selecting
  a subset of volunteers from the SAB, based on interest, expertise, and the content
  of the scenarios, to provide more frequent comment and feedback as the details of
  the five scenarios mentioned above are finalized. The entire SAB will be reconvened
  in fall 2021 to review the results of work by the project team on analyzing the
  five scenarios.</p>"
