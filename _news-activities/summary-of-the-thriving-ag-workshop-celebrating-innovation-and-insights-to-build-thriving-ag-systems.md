  Royer (Research Opportunities)</p><p><strong>Day 1
  Summary</strong></p><p>Members of the Thriving Ag Project Team met to discuss
  project successes, challenges, and opportunities. Key accomplishments included
  <em>investing in people</em>, by training 23 graduate students, supporting 6
  post-docs, and sustaining connections with original and new stakeholders;
  <em>managing on-farm nutrient losses</em>, by developing and sharing nitrogen
  tool recommendations in Pennsylvania and investigating cover crop practices in
  Maryland; <em>improving models across scales, </em>by simulating on-farm
  nutrient losses in the Bay model, state-wide manure management scenarios,
  system-wide supply chain changes, and nation-wide land use changes;
  <em>estimating variation in value </em>of best management practices and “local
  food” markets across rural and urban gradients; and <em>making outreach more
  effective, </em>by synthesizing best practices for practitioners conducting
  landowner outreach. One noted action item was to assure that we quantify
  successes through up-to-date metrics on outreach and
  publications.</p><p>Project team members noted that successes were not without
  challenges. Shared challenges included <em>COVID and post-COVID
  disruptions</em>, which limited in-person interactions; <em>project
  complexity</em>, which made concisely and accessibly sharing all aspects of
  such a broad project difficult; <em>stakeholder burdens and changes in
  interest</em>,<em> </em>including fluctuating engagement over time
  particularly for scenarios or outcomes that may not directly invest in
  stakeholder interests; <em>issues of scale</em>, including lacking micro-level
  data to capture farm heterogeneity for macro-level analyses; <em>issues of
  state and federal policy changes</em>, including loss of federal
  collaborators<em> </em>particularly from USDA, NRCS, and ARS; and <em>outcome
  delays or loss after team members departed, </em>such as pending or shelved
  publications from now-graduated trainees.</p><p>The discussion shifted from
  project reflections to opportunities. We first discussed opportunities to
  share findings from Thriving Ag. Plans included writing a Final Project Report
  both to NIFA and to the broader public as a web-based document through Penn
  State’s College of Agricultural Sciences. These efforts could be complemented
  with publications in regional stakeholder outlets (e.g., Bay Journal,
  Lancaster Farming, Delmarva Farmer) and in alternative formats (i.e., videos
  or podcasts), depending on the approval of the project’s second no-cost
  extension.</p><p>We concluded with opportunities to expand on these findings
  through future research in Thriving Ag 2.0. Building on prior discussions, we
  explored four potential themes:</p><p>Theme 1 <em>BMP adoption</em>. This
  theme would dive deeper into adoption behavior, examine slippage and
  unintended consequences, consider pay for conservation incentivization, and
  integrate adoption behavior into farm sustainability particularly as lands
  transition in use and ownership.</p><p>Theme 2 <em>Measuring environmental
  benefits. </em>This theme would consider how water quality protection and
  co-benefits differ across local scales, how these benefits change with
  targeted or clustered spatial arrangements of BMPs, and how to better quantify
  net benefits of conservation programs.</p><p>Theme 3<em> Larger systemic
  issues.</em> This theme would scale to system-level issues such as how locals
  BMPs are (or are not) manifesting in system benefits, how legacy pollution
  complicates these benefits, how to shift towards policies in nonpoint source
  pollution that internalize externalities, and how to standardize uncertainty
  across the system.</p><p>Theme 4 <em>Technological and industrial solutions.
  </em>This theme would examine new or expansion of existing technology such as
  manure treatments (particularly for poultry litter), greenhouses, aquaculture,
  urban growing, and other alternative revenue streams related to more niche or
  non-arable land-based agriculture.</p><p>To explore these themes in Thriving
  Ag’s next iteration, we considered a few key questions on framing to keep or
  expand, namely <em>(1) Should we keep the “urbanization interface” framing?
  (2) Should we keep our focus at the Chesapeake Bay scale? (3) Should we expand
  into industry-based solutions? </em>and<em> (4) Should we expand into
  collaborations with new stakeholders? </em>These questions remain open for
  discussion, but we found broad support for deepening connections with existing
  stakeholders (Chesapeake Bay Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, and state
  agencies) as well as expanding to engage new stakeholders (including, but not
  limited to, Land and Litter, Maryland State Food Council, Global Food
  Institute in DC, the new Ag Advisory Committee to the Bay Program, Susquehanna
  River Basin Commission and Potomac equivalent, Energy Works). As we await the
  RFA for Thriving Ag 2.0, there may be an opportunity to talk with stakeholders
  first to distill ideas on our four themes before
  writing.</p><p><strong>Thriving Ag Stakeholder Workshop<br /></strong>Date:
  May 29, 2025<br />Attendees: Thriving Ag Project Team and Project
  Stakeholders</p><p>Facilitators: Dave Abler (Introduction), Matt Royer &amp;
  Matt Ehrhart (Panel Sessions), Nancy Nunn (Structured Discussion on Future
  Directions)</p><p><strong>Day 2 Summary</strong></p><p>Thriving Ag Project
  stakeholders and team members came together to share project findings with
  stakeholders and discuss the future of Thriving Ag. After a welcome and
  introduction from Project Director, Dave Abler, participants listened to three
  “podcast-style” panel sessions hosted by Matt Royer (Director, Agriculture and
  Environment Center, Penn State) and Matt Ehrhart (Director of Watershed
  Restoration, Stroud Water Research Center). Each panel session corresponded to
  a scenario explored in the Thriving Ag Project to create economically and
  environmentally thriving agricultural systems in urbanized
  landscapes:</p><p><strong>Episode 1: Conservation Innovations </strong>offered
  insights into Thriving Ag’s <em>Scenario 2:</em> <em>Incentivize ecosystems
  services and mass nutrient balance on farms</em>. This panel featured<strong>
  </strong>Charlie White (Associate Professor and Extension Specialist, Soil
  Fertility and Nutrient Management, Penn State), Lisa Wainger (Professor of
  Environmental Economics, University of Maryland Center for Environmental
  Science), Mark Dubin (Faculty Specialist, University of Maryland Extension),
  and Hans Schmidt (Assistant Secretary of Resource Conservation,<em>
  </em>Maryland Department of Agriculture).</p><p>Episode 1 began our discussion
  of conservation innovations at the farm-scale. Thriving Ag team members
  fine-tuned field nitrogen (N) recommendations to develop a farm-trialed N tool
  that is now live on the Penn State extension website. This transitioned into
  how such innovations are adopted by farmers, where technical service providers
  play a critical role in BMP outreach. Project members found that some best
  practices for farmer outreach included offering financial incentives to
  mitigate risk (the biggest factor), listening first, framing messaging around
  profitability, making the process of BMP adoption easier, sending trusted
  messengers, and showing before-and-after photos of BMPs. The idea of BMP
  affordability led to a highlight of the LEEF (Leaders in Environmentally
  Engaged Farming) program in Maryland, which credits farmers who are investing
  in assets to their community (e.g., food banks, rotary clubs) as a branding
  mechanism for other revenue streams. The audience was interested in how the
  LEEF program could be applied to existing frameworks in other states like
  Pennsylvania.</p><p><strong>Episode 2: Preserving Farmland, Preserving
  Farmers</strong> offered insights into <em>Scenario 3. Evaluate the role that
  land use regulations and other forms of land-based policies, such as farmland
  preservation, play in making agriculture successful or unsuccessful in an
  urbanizing environment. </em>This panel featured Doug Wrenn (Associate
  Professor of Environmental and Resource Economics, Penn State), Nate Hu (PhD
  Graduate, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Virginia Tech),
  Doug Wolfgang (Executive Secretary, PA State Conservation Commission), and
  Jeff Swinehart (President and CEO, Lancaster Farmland Trust).</p><p>Episode 2
  focused on the Thriving Ag team that explored the marketability factors
  related to solar installations, farmland preservation, and BMP values. The
  team found that solar installations in a 2-mile radius increased (+20%)
  farmland value of the land but decreased (-5%) house values. The audience
  questions focused on these findings and on future solar research, which
  entailed agrivoltaics, Maryland’s bill on solar installation of farmland, and
  how to work with solar and data centers to save farmland. Relating to farmland
  preservation and preservation, the panel discussed successful models in
  Pennsylvania to match funding on certification and protection of farms (e.g.,
  the Growing Greener Program), as well as how to integrate these models with
  plain-sect communities. The discussion ended with a conversation regarding the
  need to balance conservation practices with agricultural practices for
  economic viability.</p><p><strong>Episode 3: Ag in this Brave New World
  </strong>offered insights into <em>Scenario 4. Increase farm profitability
  through enhanced local food efforts and growing urban/rural relationships.
  </em>This panel featured Ted Jaenicke (Professor of Agricultural Economics,
  Penn State), Dave Abler (Project Director and Professor of Agricultural
  Economics, Penn State), Caitlin Grady (Associate Professor, Engineering
  Management &amp; Systems Engineering, George Washington University), and Mike
  Roth (Director of Conservation and Innovation, PA Department of
  Agriculture).</p><p>Episode 3 featured the team that explored the term “local
  food” and its value for consumers. The major takeaways were that defining
  “local food” is complex, and some consumers in urban areas may expect a
  discount on local foods rather than paying a premium. Other researchers
  contrasted the tradeoffs of keeping food local because, at the system-level in
  the Chesapeake Bay, nutrient flows in the supply chain export ~40 million tons
  of excess nitrogen through food. This sparked discussion on broader systems of
  food supply including the role of American agriculture in the global market,
  the role of imported food in American diets, and the role of new import
  tariffs in shifting local production and consumption. The panel ended with new
  innovations, such as AI for augmenting and supporting agricultural workers
  rather than replacing workers, and how this could conflict or synergize with
  energy needs. Audience questions related to gaps in all research topics,
  particularly on the methods for local foods and system models.</p><p>The
  workshop concluded with a structured discussion, led by Nancy Nunn (Assistant
  Director, Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology), where small groups wrote
  answers to five questions:</p><p><em>What are some ideas that you’ve heard
  today that are ready to scale up?</em> Shared ideas included widespread
  adoption of the N tool; preparation of warehouses, data centers, and
  brownfields to be solar ready; state certifications for farm sustainability
  (i.e., LEEF in Maryland and PACS in Pennsylvania); and innovation of waste
  (both food and manure) to generate energy and other
  co-products.</p><p><em>What is the impact of current events on these
  issues?</em> Shared ideas included unlocking federal, state, and local
  innovation; changing crop patterns, BMP effectiveness, and water quality;
  changing regulations, enforcement, and perception (e.g., eroding farmers’
  trust in programs and technical assistance); losing knowledge and long-term
  research; and, generally, facing uncertainty in funding, employment, and
  programs’ longevity.</p><p><em>What are future research needs, and what were
  some of the gaps in the research?</em> Shared ideas included developing
  connections between environmental and economic models; incentivizing and
  motivating stakeholder engagement in research; understanding direct sale
  pricing and willingness to pay for local foods; understanding impacts of
  energy infrastructure changes (e.g., data centers), policy approaches, and ag
  land’s role in energy production; seeking resiliency in ag systems (e.g.,
  shifting crop production in response to climate change); acquiring “better”
  data (longer term, finer scale) on BMPs, the value of ag land, and ag
  employment and farm financials; and learning from other
  countries.</p><p><em>Who else should hear about this? Who might benefit and
  how might it be disseminated? </em>Shared ideas included telling consumers
  (particularly through labeling and certifying local foods), federal USDA staff
  and administration, farmers, policymakers at local and county levels, supply
  chain folks (e.g., co-ops, retailers, technical service providers,
  contractors), developers and investors (especially for energy sectors), and
  other academics across disciplines. Ideas on how to disseminate findings
  included through podcasts, influencers, formal media outlets (i.e.,
  pop-science publications), and high school curricula (e.g., food system
  courses, CASE 4 Learning, Envirothon).</p><p><a
