  <p>Under Scenario 1, existing trends in urbanization, agriculture, food
  consumption, and climate continue as is, with the ramifications of “business
  as usual” projected over the next 25 years. To help understand those trends, a
  Thriving Ag undergraduate research intern in each of the major Bay states of
  Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania worked with the research team to analyze
  existing datasets in four important categories impacting Chesapeake Bay
  agriculture: urbanization and population growth; land use; agricultural
  production; and food systems and consumption.</p><p><a
