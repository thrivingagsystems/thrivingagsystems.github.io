### Thriving Ag Project

Welcome to the website for the Thriving Agricultural Systems in Urbanized Landscapes project! This 5-year, $9 million project funded by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is working to create economically thriving and environmentally beneficial agricultural systems in urbanized landscapes. These agricultural systems are located in metropolitan counties and in non-metropolitan counties adjacent to metro areas, and are vital to the sustainability of U.S. agriculture. Over 60% of U.S. net farm income comes from these urbanized landscapes.

#### The Project Story

A sustainable and economically viable agriculture is essential for the future of our environment and quality of life. Support for functional, healthy ecosystems and profitable farming is necessary for this future.

The Thriving Agricultural Systems in Urbanized Landscapes project aims to achieve an economically and environmentally sustainable agriculture in urbanized landscapes over the next 25 years. The Chesapeake Bay watershed is being used as a case study for the project, with research findings that are translatable to other urbanized landscapes. A team of researchers from Penn State, the University of Maryland, Virginia Tech, Ohio State, Utah State, and the Stroud Water Research Center are working to achieve these goals with input from key stakeholders who are part of the agricultural and environmental communities. Together, the team is dedicated to creating economically thriving and environmentally beneficial agricultural systems in urbanized landscapes.
