White, Sanders, Ordonez, and Rivera-Ocasio are working to develop a functioning adaptive management watershed site and to validate a new nitrogen fertilizer recommendation framework for corn in on-farm experiments.

This team has identified an adaptive management field site in State College, PA. They installed groundwater monitoring wells, soil water samplers, and a network of soil moisture sensors at the site. They are collecting soil water samples. The team has also installed a runoff collection system, so they can obtain data about overland flow at the site. They will continue collecting samples so they can build a robust data set for this experiment.

Each growing season, the team conducts a series of on-farm experiments on different soil types and with different cover crop management practices. Six different nitrogen rates are applied to the corn to develop a yield response curve to applied nitrogen. The results of the yield response curve, and measurements of plant biomass partitioning and N uptake will help the team refine and validate the new nitrogen fertilizer recommendation framework that credits N from cover crops and soil organic matter.
